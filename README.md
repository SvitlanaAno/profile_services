# Profile Services

Simple RESTful Web Service for user profile creation/update. 
In this project I've created Resource Representation Class, Resource Controller and Error handler classes and made fake repository (simple java class) for storing data. Iâ€™ve made REST API which provide methods for finding, creating and updating existing users profile with json responses.


## Libraries used in this project
- Spring Boot web.
- Thymeleaf as template engine
- HTML 5 and Bootstrap 4 for responsive user interface
